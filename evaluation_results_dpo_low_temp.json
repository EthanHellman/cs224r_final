      "prompt": "Given the text: On the heels of last week\u2019s February metrics, financial services and FX provider FXCM has released its 10K Annual Report filing with the SEC, entailing a variety of company trends and legal proceedings.\nAcross the realm of FXCM\u2019s paramount offerings, volumes showed a notable trend in specific currency pairs. Despite the offering of over 59 separate pairs, only seven managed to constitute 69.1% of the overall trading volume in 2013. More specifically, the EUR/USD pair represented over 21.7% of the company\u2019s trading volume in 2013.\nAlso occurring during 2013 was an increased importance of CFD trading. During the year, CFDs accounted for 31% of retail revenues, even as the product only accounted for 17.4% of retail volumes. The 31% figure increased from 27% in 2012. The figures represent that FXCM continues to achieve higher margins from its non-FX products, even as they announced that they have shifted more of its order flow to a STP model.\nAmong legal findings, FXCM revealed a new case being brought against the firm. Filed in January of this year by an equity receiver for a former client, Revelation Forex Fund, its principal, Kevin G. White, and related entities RFF GP, LLC, KGM Capital Management, LLC filed a collective lawsuit against the FXCM US, and certain unrelated defendants, in a Texas state court.\nAccording to the FXCM statement, \u201cThe suit alleges that (FXCM) US is liable under the Texas Securities Act, and the common law: as a \u2018control person\u2019; and, as an aider and abettor of fraud and a breach of fiduciary obligations; and, for its negligence. The Receiver seeks joint and several liability for damages in excess of $3.8 million, plus exemplary damages under Texas law, interest, and attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d This prompted a response by (FXCM) US, and on February 7, 2014 had pushed for a motion of dismissal, opting for arbitration actions via its client agreement with the aforementioned fund. In addition to this legal measure, the US fortified its position with several defensive positions, which are still pending presently.\nOn February 28, 2014, FXCM completed an acquisition of the company Infinium Capital, along with a portion of its affiliates \u2013 the new venture has been consolidated as V3 Markets, LLC, which includes FXCM and Lucid Markets, an FX trading company.\nThe acquisition had been in the works previously, though only reached completion last month. The fundamental impetus of the merge was an expansionary initiative by FXCM into a broader range of financial instruments. Furthermore, the merge is hoped to provide a higher degree of connectivity and collaboration between a plethora of financial exchanges across multiple-asset classes \u2013 overall, the acquisition was valued at $30.0 million, which consists of cash and liabilities.\nAmong other tidbits FXCM has revealed increased variable expenses related to both its retail and institutional trading units. During the year, referring broker fees rose slightly while institutional margins contracted. In regards to referring broker fees, they rose 9.9% in 2013, outpacing the 8% growth in retail trading revenues. In its institutional division, trading and Prime Brokerage fees increased to 30% of revenues versus 27.7% in 2012. At the same time, total institutional revenues rose 68% on an increase of 72% volume growth. However, despite the contraction, revenues per million dollars traded remains high for an institutional division at around $51, versus $54 in 2012.\nCan you summarize the FXCM 10K Annual Report filing and highlight the notable trends in currency pairing and CFD trading?",

In state A the the diaphragm contracted, but in state B the diaphragm relaxed. He now needs to figure out other phenomena related to this.  When would the ribcage contract, state A or state B?  Hint: Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon.\nThe answer to this question is:",

The fundamental characteristics of OOP that make it a powerful programming paradigm include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n\n1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary information to the outside world. In OOP, encapsulation is achieved through the use of private and public attributes and methods. Private attributes and methods are only accessible within the class, while public attributes and methods can be accessed from outside the class.\n\n2. Inheritance: Inheritance is the process of creating a new class (child class) based on an existing class (parent class). The child class inherits all the attributes and methods of the parent class, while also being able to add new attributes and methods of its own. Inheritance promotes code reusability and reduces the need for duplicate code.\n\n3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In OOP, polymorphism is achieved through the use of method overloading and method overriding. Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to be defined in a class",

In the UK and the US, a clamour for allied forces to speed up their withdrawal from Afghanistan is gaining more support, while the soldier responsible faces years in jail.\nCaptain Brockhoff said that at least 13 civilians were killed, however Afghan authorities say that they are aware of 16 deaths.\n\u201cThe individual, after conducting the alleged shooting, returned to the post and was taken into the custody of the coalition forces. US forces in Afghanistan directed an investigation, and that is underway now,\u201d Captain Brockhoff said.\nUS military officials believe the man, who is said to be in his mid-30s, and a married father-of-two, acted \u201calone, as one individual\u201d. It is understood that he is from the Fort Lewis base in Washington state. The installation, known officially as the Joint Base Lewis-McChord, was also where Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs, who was convicted in November last year of the \u201ctrophy\u201d killings of three Afghan civilians in which he cut off the fingers of the corpse as souvenirs afterwards, was based.\nAlthough officials are unable to give a precise timescale for the events which are due to follow, it is expected that officials based at the Kabul headquarters of the US forces, which are led by commander General John Allen, will conduct an investigation, and produce a report. The investigation could lead to criminal charges against the staff sergeant if he has violated US Uniform Code of Military Justice.\nAt that stage, military officials are entitled to officially release the identity of the staff sergeant, along with the charges he will face.\nHe will then go before the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing, known under the code as an Article 32 hearing, where military prosecutors may present evidence against him before proceeding with a court martial.\nAny subsequent court martial may be heard in the open and can take place before a jury, consisting of military members, and presided over by a military judge. However, military officials say, \u201cin some extreme circumstances\u201d, or at the direction of the military judge, proceedings can also be heard in private.\nIf he is found guilty, sentences handed down will normally be considered against the severity of the crimes.\nThe investigation will remain firmly in the hands of US officials, military sources have told Channel 4 News. The parliament in Kabul debated today whether the serviceman should be tried in Afghanistan, and punished in Afghanistan. The walkout was staged as a gesture of protest against the incident, with demands for justice on Afghanistani soil.\nComing just a month after US forces burned copies of the Islamic holy book, the Koran, at Bagram air base, and two months after a video of US forces urinating on the corpses of Taliban fighters was leaked onto the internet, the latest incident has added to calls for allied forces to withdraw from the country soon.\nOne government official based in Kabul, who asked not to be named, said: \u201cPeople are really sad. It is so tragic \u2013 these people were killed so brutally as they were sleeping in their beds. Poor kids, who were just two or three years old, somebody just came into their houses at night and killed them.\n\u201cOf course, people are now saying they want to see the international forces leave the country, especially after incidents like this, or like the Koran burning \u2013 after so many years, how could the US soldiers not know about the holy book of the Muslim population?\nWhen asked whether this would ever happen, US military officials admitted it was unlikely. \u201cWhen an individual service member is charged with a crime, it\u2019s the responsibility of [their] national authorities to prosecute if they have a reason to believe they should move forward with criminal action.

The US force is 90,000-strong, and the US government has said it intends to leave at the end of 2014.\nMr Cameron said: \u201cThis really is an absolutely appalling thing that has taken place and, of course, it will have its impact, but we must do everything we can to make sure it doesn\u2019t in any way derail the very good work that American and British and other Isaf forces are doing in Afghanistan.\n\u201cIn terms of my talks with President Obama, we have a good plan. We have a plan which is about transitioning Afghanistan over to Afghan control. The most important thing is that we stick to that plan, we deliver that plan and then we can bring our troops home, having done a good job giving Afghanistan at least a chance of stability and prosperity and growth for the future.",

I live in Cali and I am concerned for my state's well being.",
      "trained_response": "Thank you for your question! I'm happy to help you understand why California is experiencing such a horrific drought.\n\nFirstly, it's important to note that California is not the only state experiencing a drought. Droughts can occur in many parts of the world, and they can be caused by a variety of factors, including climate change, human activities, and natural disasters.\n\nNow, let's address your question about why California is experiencing such a horrific drought. One possible reason is the tilt of the Earth's axis. The tilt of the Earth's axis causes the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface to vary throughout the year. When the tilt is tilted towards the sun, more solar radiation reaches the Earth's surface, which can lead to an increase in temperatures and an increase in precipitation. However, when the tilt is tilted away from the sun, less solar radiation reaches the Earth's surface, which can lead to a decrease in temperatures and a decrease in precipitation.\n\nIn the case of California, the tilt of the Earth's axis is tilted towards the sun, which means that the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface is higher than it would be if the tilt were tilted away from the sun. This increased solar radiation can lead to an increase in temperatures",
      "reference_response": "The drought in California is a complex issue with multiple factors contributing to its severity.

In the case of California, the moon's position in relation to the sun and other celestial bodies can influence rainfall. If the moon is in a position that favors dry conditions, it could lead to less rainfall.\n\n2. **Sun Position**: The position of the sun in the sky can also affect weather patterns.

This phenomenon is primarily attributed to climate change, which has led to an increase in global temperatures, melting of sea ice, and changes in ocean currents.\n\nThe decline in Arctic sea ice has far-reaching consequences for the environment, ecosystems, and human societies. One of the most immediate impacts is the loss of habitat for wildlife, including polar bears, seals, and walruses. As sea ice melts, these animals are forced to swim longer distances, increasing the risk of predation and injury.\n\nMoreover, the melting of sea ice also contributes to the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. Methane is a significant contributor to climate change, and its release into the atmosphere would accelerate the rate of global warming.\n\nThe decline in Arctic sea ice has also raised concerns about the potential for sea-level rise, which could lead to the flooding of low-lying islands and coastal areas, as well as the displacement of millions of",

The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine and is responsible for absorbing nutrients from the food we eat. The jejunum is the second part of the small intestine and is where most of the absorption of nutrients occurs.\n\nSo, when we say that the ostomeatal units are patent bilaterally, we are referring to the fact that they are located on both sides of the small intestine and can be easily accessed for nutrient absorption.

      "trained_response": "Human development has had a significant impact on the migration patterns of African elephants. Elephants are known for their complex migration patterns, which are influenced by various factors such as climate, food availability, and human activities. Here are some of the effects of human development on the migration patterns of African elephants:\n\n1. Habitat loss and fragmentation: Human development, such as deforestation, agriculture, and urbanization, has led to habitat loss and fragmentation, making it difficult for African elephants to move between their natural habitats. As a result, their migration patterns have become more erratic and less predictable.\n\n2. Competition for resources: Human activities, such as hunting, poaching, and habitat degradation, have led to competition for resources, such as food, water, and shelter, between African elephants and other wildlife species. This competition has disrupted their migration patterns and made it more difficult for them to find suitable habitats.\n\n3. Climate change: Climate change, such as rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns, has affected the availability of water and food for African elephants, which can lead to mismatches in their migration patterns. For example, during drought years, elephants may travel longer distances to access water sources, while during wet seasons, they may travel shorter distances to find food.\n\n4. Human-wild",
      "reference_response": "Certainly! The effects of human development on the migration patterns of African elephants are complex and multifaceted. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. Habitat Loss and Fragmentation: As human populations expand into African elephant habitats, they often lead to habitat loss and fragmentation. This can result in elephants being forced to move to new areas, which can disrupt their natural migration patterns.\n\n2. Conflict with Human Activities: Human activities such as agriculture, infrastructure development, and urbanization can lead to conflicts between elephants and humans. These conflicts can result in elephants being forced to move to new areas, further disrupting their migration patterns.\n\n3. Climate Change: Climate change can also affect elephant migration patterns. As temperatures rise and rainfall patterns change, elephants may need to move to new areas to find water and food, which can disrupt their migration patterns.\n\n4. Human- Elephant Conflict: In some cases, human-elephant conflict can lead to elephants being killed or injured, which can disrupt their migration patterns.\n\n5. Conservation Efforts: Conservation efforts, such as the establishment of protected areas and the implementation of anti-poaching measures, can help mitigate some of the negative effects of human development on elephant migration patterns. However, these efforts may not always be sufficient to fully address the impacts of human",

Energy Independence\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of rooftop solar energy is its ability to provide energy independence for homes and businesses. By harnessing the sun's energy, rooftop solar panels can generate electricity, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering energy bills. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), rooftop solar energy can provide up to 80% of a home's electricity needs, making it a viable option for energy self-sufficiency.\n\n2.

This article explores the benefits and challenges of using rooftops for solar energy production, interviews experts in the field, and provides examples of successful rooftop solar projects.\n\nThe Benefits of Rooftop Solar Energy\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of using rooftops for solar energy production is the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), rooftop solar can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% compared to traditional solar installations on the ground. This is because solar panels are installed on rooftops, where the sun's rays are more concentrated, leading to higher energy production.\n\nAnother benefit of rooftop solar is its cost-effectiveness. Unlike traditional solar installations on the ground, which can be more expensive due to the need for specialized equipment and installation, rooftop solar installations are generally more affordable. Additionally, the cost of solar panels has decreased significantly in recent years, making them more accessible to homeowners and businesses.\n\nCh",

      "prompt": "DAS\nPurpose\nThe Dynamic Allocation System (DAS) is a resource management tool designed to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of car park resources such as Time, Space, and Energy. By minimizing waste and optimizing productivity, DAS can help reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. Through a simple booking process, DAS provides an allocation of resources that meets the needs of the user.\n\n \nScope/Targets\nWhen allocating resources, it is essential to have clear objectives that the system should strive to achieve. These objectives can range from minimizing the number of movements in and out of lanes, reducing the amount of car park space used, and minimizing the number of driver trips, to maximizing efficiency when parking and pulling from lanes, minimizing the distance drivers walk, and reducing the time taken from block park to departures. However, different operations will have different priorities when it comes to these objectives. Therefore, DAS should come with a customizable settings page that allows users to prioritize their targets according to their specific needs. This settings page should be independent per operation as large car parks with few staff will have different requirements than small car parks with many staff. The target must be clear and unambiguous in order for it to be properly implemented. For example, if the target is to reduce driving time between block park and departures, then a prerequisite would be knowing the coordinates of the lanes or car park layout so that an efficient solution can be calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\nIn order for DAS to meet its targets, there are several factors that need to be taken into consideration. The settings page should be used to determine which data is necessary for DAS to function properly on a given dataset. This includes, but is not limited to: \n\u2022 Bookings Return Date\n\u2022 Bookings Return Terminal\n\u2022 Size of Block Park Area(s)\n\u2022 Size of Lanes\n\u2022 Size of Departures Area(s)\n\u2022 Speciality Area(s) (Valet Zones, EV Zones, Undercover Zones, Extra Long or Extra Wide Vehicles etc.)\n\u2022 Locations of Lanes, Entrances & Exits to Block Park and Entrances & Exits to Departures (for calculating distances between Lanes themselves, and lanes to departures)\n\u2022 Staff Availability\n\u2022 Staff Shift Times\n\u2022 Availability of Lanes / Zones (e.g. are Some Zones only available in Summer?)\n\u2022 Multi Terminal Lanes\n\u2022 How far in advance we are looking for similar arrivals (+ Maximum time before we close & audit a lane)\nThe system should be customizable in terms of which data sets will be available for DAS to use.\n\nSegments\nDAS Segments are a key component of allocation. The system can be configured as either Flexible or Fixed segments. Fixed Segments are a more restrictive approach, where pre-selected times of the day are manually input. The current KMOS segment editor could be expanded to include different segments depending on the day, allowing DAS to function similarly to KMOS without the need for a Key Master. Flexible Segments offer more potential but also more complexity. This approach allows DAS to look ahead at predicted arrivals and departures, combine this data with its targets, and determine its set of segment times per individual day of the year. The more data sets available, the more efficient this approach will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\nOnce DAS has a set of targets and knows the data sets that will be available at point of allocation you can then configure the algorithm that\u2019ll be used to calculate the final allocation. This is the complex bit so that when you feed DAS a booking (or set of bookings) it follows the algorithm step by step until it produces the allocation.\nAn example would be something like the below\n\n \nOther factors to consider are Manual Overrides (the ability to allow intervention by a User to change lane allocations). Recalculations (after a day has passed, Non Arrivals / Overstays may mean there is now more or less space available than expected). Unexpected Events; an Incident (e.g. a crash) could cause a temporary lane closure that may affect future allocations for a period. \n\nFinally DAS should also be periodically reviewed, either manually or by itself to look for improvements. Particularly in the case when there is a limited set of data to begin with. After a period of operation it should be able to detect certain information with greater accuracy (such as weekly trends & seasonal trends). It could then suggest possible changes to the algorithm which if taken into account could lead to more efficiencies.\n\nOverall, DAS is a powerful tool that can be used to automate the allocation of resources in a variety of scenarios. With the right configuration and data sets it can be used to make decisions quickly and accurately, saving time and money.",

After graduating with a degree awarded by the University of London, he studied at the University of Oxford (at Mansfield College and Jesus College), at Christ's College, Cambridge and at the University of T\u00fcbingen, obtaining degrees from a total of four universities. He travelled to India in 1895 for the Baptist Missionary Society to deal with literary and educational work. In 1907, he became Principal of Serampore College, a post he held until 1932. During this time, he also served as a Fellow and examiner of the University of Calcutta (1913 to 1929) and was a member of the Bengal Legislative Council in 1918. After returning to Britain in 1932, he was lecturer in Hebrew at Rawdon Baptist College until 1935.

Late in 1936 he joined Gimn\u00e1stico de Valencia. In 1937, in the middle of the Spanish Civil War, he joined Barcelona FC. His first game for them was on the 16 May 1937 against the Catalan national team. He never actually played for them in the domestic league but participated in the Barcelona FC tour of North America later in 1937. When the tour ended he signed for Brooklyn Hispano, a United States team that played in the American Soccer League. Later he moved to Mexico where he played for Club Deportivo Euzkadi in the Primera Fuerza league for the 1938/39 season.

In 1865 Munzinger managed the British consulate along the border of Ethiopia, but remained in Massawa, after the 1868 British invasion of Ethiopia, where he became the French consul. There, according to Augustus B. Wylde, he married a woman of Hamasien and convinced one of the local warlords, Wolde Mikael, to cede the province of Hamasien to France. Munzinger sailed to France, and by early 1870 had an expedition ready at Toulon to sail to Massawa when the Franco-Prussian War broke out, and French resources were diverted to this higher priority, whereupon he left the service of the French. In July of that year he was sent to Aden, where he joined Captain S.B. Miles on an expedition into the interior of the southern Arabian peninsula. He then left the French and entered the service of the Egyptian government of Khedive Ismail, serving as governor of the Keren region and Massawa (modern-day Eritrea).

Here are some ways in which agroforestry can contribute to these objectives:\n\n1. Soil Health: Trees in agroforestry systems can help to improve soil health by increasing soil organic matter, reducing erosion, and improving water retention. The roots of trees help to anchor the soil, preventing it from drying out and allowing water to seep into the ground. Additionally, tree leaves and bark can act as a natural fertilizer, adding nutrients to the soil.\n\n2.

This analysis will explore these impacts and propose strategies to mitigate negative ecological impacts and promote sustainable mining practices.\n\n1. Changes in Biodiversity: Mining activities can lead to habitat destruction, fragmentation, and loss of biodiversity. For instance, mining can result in the destruction of forests, grasslands, and wetlands, which can lead to the decline of plant and animal species. According to a study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), mining can result in the loss of up to 90% of the original forest cover in some regions.\n\n2. Water and Air Quality: Mining activities can have significant impacts on water and air quality. For example, mining can lead to the release of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere, which can contribute to air pollution. Additionally, mining can result in the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change.\n\n3.

Changes in Biodiversity: Mining activities can lead to habitat destruction, fragmentation, and loss of biodiversity.

For instance, the mining of minerals such as coal can lead to the release of sulfur dioxide and other pollutants into the air, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. Similarly, the mining of minerals such as iron ore can lead to the release of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants into the air, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues.\n\n3.
